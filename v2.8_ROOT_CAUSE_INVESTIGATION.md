# 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - Display Issue Found!

## What I Found

Your console logs show **CORRECT data** in the database:
- Student 2022-171253 (Hayasaka): `10.01`, `10.00` (raw scores)

But your **grading table shows PERCENTAGES** for this student:
- Displays: `59.67%`, `78.00%`, `70.67%`

**This means the data is correct, but something is REPLACING the input fields with percentages!**

## Deployed v2.8 with Investigation Code

I've added **POST-RENDER verification** to check what's actually in the DOM after the table renders.

### Steps to Debug:

1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + F5`
2. **Open Console**: `F12`
3. **Load your grading component**
4. **Look for this section** in the console:
   ```
   🔍 POST-RENDER VERIFICATION
   🔍 Found X input fields in DOM
   🔍 Input[0]: Student 2022-118764, Col 175 = "9.97" (bg: rgb(255, 255, 255))
   🔍 Input[1]: Student 2022-118764, Col 176 = "10" (bg: rgb(255, 255, 255))
   ...
   🔍 Input[6]: Student 2022-171253, Col 175 = "?" (bg: ?)
   🔍 POST-RENDER VERIFICATION COMPLETE
   ```

5. **Send me** what Input[6], Input[7], Input[8] show for the second student

## Why This Matters

- If Input[6] shows `"10.01"` (correct) but displays as `59.67%` on screen → There's CSS or JavaScript REPLACING the values
- If Input[6] shows `"59.67%"` in the DOM → The HTML generation is wrong, not display
- If Input[6] shows `"NaN"` or empty → The calculation has a bug

## Quick Check

After v2.8 loads, scroll down in console and look for **🔍 POST-RENDER VERIFICATION** section. Compare:

| What Console 🔍 Shows | What Table Shows | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `"10.01"` | `59.67%` | CSS/JS replacing content |
| `"59.67%"` | `59.67%` | HTML generation wrong |
| `"NaN"` or empty | `59.67%` | Calculation bug + fallback |
| `"10.01"` | `10.01` | Working correctly! |

**Report back with the 🔍 POST-RENDER section and I'll pinpoint the exact issue!**
